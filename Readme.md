MCTS logic taken primarily from [Alfredo de  la fuente](https://github.com/Alfo5123/Connect4)

Minimax logic taken primarily from [Erik Ackermann](https://github.com/erikackermann/Connect-Four)

1. [connect4.py](https://github.com/AHarmlessPyro/4511W_Final_Project/blob/master/MonteMin/connect4.py)comes from Erik Ackermann and **was heavily modified** to allow connecting the two algorithms using files.
2. [mcts.py](https://github.com/AHarmlessPyro/4511W_Final_Project/blob/master/MonteMin/mcts.py) comes from Alfredo de la fuente and **was Heavily modified** to remove all TKinter components and instead print to a file and read from a file and also to port it from python 2 to python 3.
3. [minimax.py](https://github.com/AHarmlessPyro/4511W_Final_Project/blob/master/MonteMin/minimax.py) comes from Erik Ackermann and was **NOT** modified
4. [play.py](https://github.com/AHarmlessPyro/4511W_Final_Project/blob/master/MonteMin/play.py) was comes from Erik Ackermann and **was slightly modified** to suit it to our needs
5. [ResetFile.py](https://github.com/AHarmlessPyro/4511W_Final_Project/blob/master/MonteMin/ResetFile.py) **was made by us**.
6. [controller.py](https://github.com/AHarmlessPyro/4511W_Final_Project/blob/master/MonteMin/controller.py) **was made by us** and is used to allow for print and read capabilities.

Game can be run by \**insert python3 command*\* play.py when inside MonteMin folder
